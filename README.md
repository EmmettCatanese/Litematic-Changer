# Litematic-Changer
Tool for Litematic files to replace all blocks of one type to another while maintaining their state.

When playing Minecraft and using Litematics I found it annoying that the original schematic maker would often make the large masses of building blocks ones that were inconvenient for me. Why use iron blocks when I can use cobblestone? While Litematica does have a feature to replace blocks, it's annoying to use and doesn't maintain block states or find all of the blocks in that block state (ex: if I don't explicitly tell it to replace West facing upside down stairs, it won't replace it)

I made this tool to solve this problem! Once you upload your file you can then pick the block(s) you want to replace out of the list and input the new block(s) you want. Then, it'll generate you a new Litematic with the right blocks! Super quick and easy!
